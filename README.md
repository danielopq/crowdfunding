## Overview

This project is a fully responsive crowdfunding website developed without the use of frameworks or libraries, utilizing only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site adapts seamlessly between desktop and mobile versions, providing an optimized experience across devices.

Key interactive features controlled with JavaScript include:

  - Dynamic Pledge Tracking: Each time a pledge is submitted, JavaScript updates the total amount backed, the number of backers, and the progress bar to reflect the campaign's approach toward its funding goal.
  - Bookmark Button with Dual States: Users can toggle a bookmark button to save or unsave the campaign, with clear visual changes to indicate each state.
  - Pledge Type Selection: The interface allows users to select different pledge tiers. When a user chooses a pledge type, the interface updates to display only the relevant input fields and information for the selected tier.
  - Pledge Validation: To ensure data consistency, the pledge input fields are validated to accept only numbers without initial zeros, enforcing a minimum required amount for each pledge tier.

This crowdfunding site combines simplicity and interactive functionality, providing users with an engaging experience without relying on external libraries or frameworks.

## My process

I initially developed the website fully for the desktop version, focusing on creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. Once the desktop layout was complete, I concentrated on implementing JavaScript functionality to manage interactive elements across the site, including dynamic updates to the pledge amount, backer count, and progress bar, as well as toggling bookmark states and validating pledge inputs.

After ensuring all interactive elements worked seamlessly and met the design specifications, I adapted the layout for mobile devices by using CSS media queries. This approach allowed for a streamlined, responsive experience without altering the underlying structure, ensuring consistency and optimal functionality on both desktop and mobile platforms.
